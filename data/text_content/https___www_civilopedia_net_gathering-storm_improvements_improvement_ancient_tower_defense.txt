Barricade - Improvements and Routes - Civilopedia - Civilization VI
Barricade
Description
An unworkable early Improvement that deals minor damage to, and exerts zone of control on, hostile units passing through or adjacent to it. Unlocked with Military Engineering and built using a Builder Charge. Does not prevent unit movement through this space.
Historical Context
The uncanniness of zombies comes from their ambiguity. Are they simply animate material, or are they living beings of a sort? Defenses against people rely upon a number of things that simply do not apply to walking corpses: pain, intimidation, exhaustion. Barbed wire means nothing to something that cannot feel. Additionally, zombie weaponry is limited: zombies do not build trebuchets; they do not fire arrows. So defenses against the dead treat the un-living not as a thinking enemy, but as moving matter – sharpened sticks to not seek to kill, but to immobilize, towers with retractable ladders provide refuge from enemies without brains to climb a rope, ditches contain enemies who cannot build a bridge. At least, until there’s too many of them.
