Unique Ability
Catherine’s Magnificences
Improved Luxury resources adjacent to Theater Square districts or Châteaux receive +2
Culture. May initiate the Court Festival project in any city with a Theater Square district.
Summary
Magnificence Catherine augments her usual wonder and Château building program with lavish Court Festivals that quickly push France toward a Culture Victory, especially when she’s been able to hoard a vast collection of luxuries.
Detailed Approach
Magnificence Catherine is the one leader who wants to amass a large collection of luxury resources of all types and quantities. Having a sumptuous collection of opulent goods makes her Court Festivals the cultural events where all leaders want to see and be seen. With enough such festivals and a large collection of Châteaux and mid-game wonders, France should be the leading candidate for a Culture Victory whenever this benevolent version of Catherine appears. She’s just dangerous enough at this game that you might have to fight a war against the French Garde Impériale to keep her from rolling to a quick victory.
There is a certain joy of life to our culture. It is useless to resist its charm.
