Vampire Castle
Description
Can be built in player-owned and neutral territory by a Vampire. Provides Fortification to units on the tile. Duplicates yields from adjacent tiles when built, adds them to the Vampire Castle's tile, and grants the tile's yield to the
Capital city.
Deals minor damage to and depletes the movement of hostile units walking onto this tile.
Historical Context
Stoker’s Dracula lived alone – undead brides aside - in a castle in the Carpathian mountains of Transylvania. When Jonathan Harker comes to conduct his business with the Count, Dracula must dress up as his own coachman, cook Harker’s meals, and, of course, make sure Harker stays locked in his room. From the balcony overlooking the Transylvanian forests, the Count broods over his past and future conquests. The inspiration for Dracula’s castle is today popularly attributed to Bran Castle in Romania, although neither Stoker nor Dracula’s supposedly real-world counterpart Vlad Tepes had anything to do with the place, instead, the castle was selected by the Romanian government as the place most evocative of the Count’s home. It remains, though, the quintessential vampire’s castle: a brooding structure on a cliff overlooking a dark forest where wolves still prowl.
