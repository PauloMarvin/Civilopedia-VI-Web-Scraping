Estádio do Maracanã
Description

Amenities in each city in your civilization. Must be built on flat land adjacent to an Entertainment Complex district with a Stadium.
Historical Context
Officially the Estadio Jornalista Mario Filho – must have been a heck of a sports writer to get a stadium named after him – but better known as the Maracanã, the fútbol stadium is part of a large complex in the heart of Rio de Janeiro. Begun in 1948 AD, after Brazil had won the right to host the FIFA World Cup, it was opened (more-or-less, for construction was not complete) for the first matches in that contest in 1950. Unfortunately, heavily favored Brazil was upset in the final by the team from Uruguay, 2-1, before a crowd of 199,854 rabid fans – making it the world’s largest (and loudest) stadium at the time. Since then the Maracanã has served as host to the Pan-American Games, another World Cup, numerous concerts and cultural events, and thousands of soccer matches. Having been renovated to a smaller capacity (78,838) and more comfortable accommodations (including 292 new toilets), the stadium hosted the Olympics (Summer, obviously) for the first time in 2016.
“Down through its history, only three people have managed to silence the Maracana: the Pope, Frank Sinatra, and me.”
– Alcides Ghiggia, Uruguayan soccer player
