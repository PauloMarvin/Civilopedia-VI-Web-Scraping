Trap - Improvements and Routes - Civilopedia - Civilization VI
Trap
Description
An unworkable early Improvement that deals moderate damage to, and depletes the movement of, hostile units passing directly through it. Unlocked with Construction and built using a Builder Charge. Does not prevent unit movement through this space.
Historical Context
While walls are a type of defense that seeks to keep enemies out, traps seek to eliminate, slow, or immobilize them. And while the walking dead are relentless, they are not clever. A single human in a tower, with his juicy human brain, can act as sufficient bait to bring the dead – or hostile humans looking to take out an “unguarded” enemy - in to close quarters where they can be dealt with. But dispensing of the dead involves much more than dealing with human enemies. They cannot be chased off, or even critically wounded; they must be destroyed. Ancient traps could involve burning pitch, hidden pits, or simply towers fill of archers. That is, until the arrows run out…
