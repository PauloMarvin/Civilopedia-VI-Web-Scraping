Spaceport
Description
A district that is required to construct the Science Victory projects. This includes Launch Earth Satellite, Launch Moon Landing, Launch Mars Colony, and Launch Exoplanet Expedition. Cannot be built on Hills.
Historical Context
The image of a spaceport (or cosmodrome) as a gateway to the stars is evocative of adventure and discovery, of the next “great frontier” for civilization. The reality is much more prosaic: a place to launch (and maybe eventually land) rockets, much like a seaport for ships or airport for planes. Like those, a spaceport consists of derricks, cranes, administration buildings, control centers, fuel tanks and the working infrastructure. The world’s first permanent facility for orbital, manned launches was Baikonur – which had started as a Soviet military test range – in 1955 AD. Spurred by that the United States soon converted the Air Force Missile Test Center at Cape Canaveral to launch sub-orbital and then orbital rocket test flights … and the space race was on.
