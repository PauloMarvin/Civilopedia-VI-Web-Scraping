Ending a War
Wars can end violently or peacefully. A war ends violently when one side is destroyed. This occurs when that side has lost its last city. The peaceful resolution of a war involves diplomatic negotiations. You or your opponent may initiate a Peace Deal. See the section on Diplomacy for further details.
Barbarians will never negotiate. War with Barbarians will continue until the Barbarians are destroyed.
