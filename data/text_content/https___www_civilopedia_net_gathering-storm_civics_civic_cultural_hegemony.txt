Cultural Hegemony
Historical Context
Certain cultures become so ubiquitous that they produce an almost gravity-like effect on the other cultures around them, shaping those cultures either by directly replacing them, or by being substantially incorporated within the culture. Rome, for instance, was a cultural hegemon of the Mediterranean. China exerted a hegemonic effect on a greater area of Asia, and for longer. The English language is accused of being a hegemonic force in the present age.
Cultural Hegemony is seen as a negative by those cultures affected by it, as the hegemony can overwrite centuries of cultural values, language, ritual, and relationships, often in a breathtakingly short period of time. Television, for example, exported a tremendous amount of American entertainment around the world in the latter half of the Twentieth Century.
“Ah, my Belovéd, fill the cup that clears
To-day of past Regrets and future Fears—
To-morrow?—Why, To-morrow I may be
Myself with Yesterday’s Sev’n Thousand Years.”
