Roads
Roads
Roads are an important part of moving around the world. Placed by Trader units beginning in the Ancient Era, roads begin by reducing the
Movement cost of a tile to 1 when moving from one road tile to another. As technology progresses, you will unlock the ability to build better and better roads, and even bridges. Modern roads, for example, reduce
Movement to a half
Movement point per tile, when moving from one road tile to another. All roads allow units to ignore terrain-based movement penalties.
Roads are placed by Traders, but may also be placed manually by Military Engineers.
