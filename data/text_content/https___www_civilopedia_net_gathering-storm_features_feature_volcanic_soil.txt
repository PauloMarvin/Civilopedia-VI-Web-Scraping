Volcanic Soil - Terrains and Features - Civilopedia - Civilization VI
Volcanic Soil
Description
This land adjacent to a volcano has suffered from a previous eruption. Although people and structures may have been damaged, the rich deposits of minerals the volcano has brought forth have probably enhanced the yields here. Rebuilding in this area may therefore be worthwhile, especially if the volcano goes dormant.
Historical Context
Volcanic ejecta is rich in minerals, and thus over time creates a rich soil with excellent drainage, ideal for cultivating certain kinds of crops. For example, grapes grown for wine flourish in volcanic soil, as attested by the Romans planting vineyards on the slopes of Mt. Vesuvius. Coffee, too, does particularly well when grown in volcanic soil. Eruptions refresh the supply of volcanic soil on a volcano, although this usually has negative effects on agriculture during the eruption.
Traits
Can receive additional yields from environmental effects.
