Introduction - Resources - Civilopedia - Civilization VI
Introduction
Resources are sources of
Food,
Production,
Science,
Gold, or
Culture, and they can provide special bonuses to a civilization. Your civilization's wealth and power will be determined by the number and kinds of resources you control to a large degree. To utilize a resource, it first must be within your civilization's borders, and then you must construct the appropriate "improvement" in that hex. For example, you must construct the Plantation improvement to get the benefit from a Banana resource.
