Culture when in a
Golden Age or Heroic Age. +4
Combat Strength when not in a

Golden Age or Heroic Age.
Summary
Suleiman celebrates the Golden Age of the Ottomans with increased
Science and
Culture. If he falls into a Dark Age his opponents should beware.
Detailed Approach
Suleiman’s strategy depends on whether he is in a Golden or Dark Age. If he is in a
Golden Age he receives +15%
Science and
Culture, so focus on progressing and enlightening your empire. When he does fall into a Dark or Normal Age use his +4
Combat Strength against other civilizations who are not in a
Golden Age. His bonuses to siege warfare gives an extra push to conquer his enemies. The Grand Bazaar gives the Ottomans stability and prosperity to a growing empire with its extra
Amenities,
Gold, and Strategic Resources. Use the Barbary Corsairs to maintain control of the waterways. The Ottomans are mostly geared for Domination Victories, but if they string enough Golden Ages together, they can achieve a Science Victory instead.
