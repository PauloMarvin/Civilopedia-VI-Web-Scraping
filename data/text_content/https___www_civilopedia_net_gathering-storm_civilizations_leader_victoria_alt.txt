Unique Ability
Age of Steam
+10%
Production in Cities for every Industrial Zone building in that city. +2
Production to all Strategic Resources.
Summary
With Victoria in the Age of Steam you can lead England into the Industrial Revolution to manufacture your victory.
Detailed Approach
England with Victoria is a
Production powerhouse.  Her initial research should be headed for Bronze Working to unlock Iron, which receives +2
Production from her leader ability and accumulates faster from her civilization ability. Then, steam towards Apprenticeship, which will unlock the Industrial Zone and Workshop. With her abilities, the Workshop will start the engine of her
Production machine. With all the Strategic Resources she will be accumulating, the Royal Naval Dockyard is a good place to store them. As she moves towards victory,
Production bonuses gear her towards either creating a large army for a Domination win or districts and buildings to propel England into space.
Great events make me quiet and calm; it is only trifles that irritate my nerves.
