Introduction - Districts - Civilopedia - Civilization VI
Introduction
In Civilization VI, buildings are no longer trapped in your city center, but may sprawl across your territory as part of districts. The map is more important than ever as you are faced with important strategic placement decisions. Campuses and Holy Site’s alike receive special boosts from placement near Mountains, but only the former also benefits from a nearby source of Rainforest.
