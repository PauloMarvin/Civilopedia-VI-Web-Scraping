Geothermal Fissure
Description
The ground in this area, probably located near a boundary between two continents, has been ruptured by subterranean geothermal activity. Heated water and steam escape from the ground here, making it ideal to place structures such as Aqueducts, Roman Baths, and Hungarian Thermal Baths nearby.
Historical Context
Places where the Earth's crust is fractured enough to allow heat from deep underground to escape are geothermal vents. These can take the form of natural hot springs, geysers, or smokers which do not rise to the energetic levels of volcanoes. These have attracted people since antiquity, drawn by the unusual geology and the attraction of warm water for bathing and ritual.
