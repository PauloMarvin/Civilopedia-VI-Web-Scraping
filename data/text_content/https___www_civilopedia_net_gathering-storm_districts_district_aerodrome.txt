Aerodrome
Description
A district that allows you to build and store aircraft. Cannot be built on Hills.
Historical Context
An aerodrome is a place where, well, aeroplanes take off and land. Technically, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization, an “aerodrome” is “a defined area on land or water … intended to be used wholly or in part for the arrival, departure, and surface movement of aircraft.” The first such district to fit that description wholly was located in Viry-Châtillon, a suburb of Paris. In those early days of flight, any open, relatively flat, grassy field would serve...and did. Which meant, unlike the present, that planes could land and take-off in any direction, adjusting for the wind direction and weather conditions, requiring nothing more than a wind-sock or flag. Then someone had the clever idea of adding paved runways, and all that landing and taking-off got far more complicated.
