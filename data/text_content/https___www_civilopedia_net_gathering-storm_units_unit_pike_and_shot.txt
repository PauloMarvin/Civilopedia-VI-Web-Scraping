Pike and Shot
Description
Late Renaissance era anti-cavalry unit.
Historical Context
The Spanish armies developed a well-rounded defensive tactic after their disastrous experience at the Battle of Seminara. Composed of pikemen and arquebusiers (infantry with early firearms), the unit moved as a cohesive block: pikemen at the center, with groups of arquebusiers surrounding them. Arquebusiers could strike enemies in range, and then fall back behind the “curtain wall” of pikemen when threatened by enemy infantry or cavalry. It worked out well for the Spanish arquebusiers, who could load their notoriously complicated armaments with minimal fear of horse trampling.
