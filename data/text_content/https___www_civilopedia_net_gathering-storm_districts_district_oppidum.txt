Oppidum
Description
A district unique to Gaul that is cheaper and available earlier than the district it replaces, the Industrial Zone. The Oppidum district is defensible with a ranged attack. When the first Oppidum is constructed the Apprenticeship technology is unlocked.

Production adjacency bonus from Quarries and strategic resources.
Historical Context
Oppidum simple means “settlement” in Latin, but in practice it referred to a walled urban settlement of a small town in Rome’s provinces – especially Gaul, and as such marks the first real cities in Europe north of the Alps. A classic oppidum was a combination of city and fort. Previously, citizens lived outside of protective walls, whereas armed soldiers or nobles had a hill fort: a high, fortified position. With an oppidum, economic and productive activity could occur in relative safety even with enemies nearly. The walls, too, made a separation between city-dwellers and rural residents, and allowed the former to feel a little sense of superiority over the latter, even if these “cities” were quite small by our – or even Roman – standards.
