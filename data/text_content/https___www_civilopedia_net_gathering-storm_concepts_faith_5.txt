Founding Your Religion
Founding Your Religion
After founding your Religion, you will be prompted to choose a name and icon to represent your beliefs. You may choose a historical Religion, or create one of your own! A newly established Religion will consist of two beliefs: a Follower belief, and one of three additional types of beliefs that can be tailored to your play style. Once your Religion is founded, all of your cities with Holy Sites will automatically convert to the Religion.
You can then use the Evangelize Belief action on Apostles to add additional beliefs to your Religion. You can have a total of 4 beliefs in a Religion.
Follower beliefs provide some kind of yield or other inherent bonus. This applies to all cities and civilizations that follow that Religion.
Founder beliefs provide a bonus that relies on the number of followers it has. Followers are citizens that follow that religion in all cities, regardless of whether or not that Religion is predominant in a city. This bonus is applied only to the civilization that founded that Religion.
Worship beliefs grant a unique type of building that can be built in Holy Sites, or purchased there with
Faith. Every Worship building has different benefits.
Enhancer beliefs help spread the religion by making its natural religious pressure stronger or by making Missionaries and Apostles cheaper.
