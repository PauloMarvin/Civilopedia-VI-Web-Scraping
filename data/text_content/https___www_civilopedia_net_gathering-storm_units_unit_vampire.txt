Vampire - Units - Civilopedia - Civilization VI
Vampire
Description
Combat unit unique to the Sanguine Pact. Has base
Combat Strength equal to the strongest unit your cities have produced. Gains permanent
Combat Strength when units die in adjacent tiles.  Strength from Barbarian deaths is capped at +10. When killed, retreats with 1 HP to the
Capital or nearest Vampire Castle. Heals an additional 50 HP from pillaging enemy tiles, but receives reduced passive healing.
Historical Context
The myth of the vampire is one that has a particular resonance in a world where hereditary aristocracy is largely a thing of the past. Cruel masters, obsessed with eternal youth, who prey upon a populace to whom they imagine themselves to be superior, full of decadent but decayed culture, hold a fascination as monarchies worldwide have fallen one by one. They emerge as sometimes tragic, sometimes horrific villains or antiheroes to a population confined to normalcy. Of these, the quintessential real-life vampire would be the Countess Elizabeth Báthory de Ecsed, a Hungarian noblewoman who, according to legend, believed that she could preserve her youth and beauty through the blood of her victims – over 600 of them.
