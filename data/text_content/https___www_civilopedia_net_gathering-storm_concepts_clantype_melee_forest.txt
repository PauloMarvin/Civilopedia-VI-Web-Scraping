Woodland Clan - Concepts - Civilopedia - Civilization VI
Woodland Clan
The Woodland clan is a type of Clan present when Barbarian Clans mode is active.
Woodland clans prefer to place their Outposts in or adjacent to woods and rainforests. They prefer greater numbers of ranged units than melee units and use them for both attack and defense.
History
For those seeking an independent life, free from cities, states and kings and all the injustices that come with them, forests provide ideal cover. They are unsuitable to the kinds of intensive grain agriculture that urbanized states depend on, and they provide plenty of places to hide from slaving runs from autocratic states or to stage raids. Here, "forest clans" refer to groups such as the Tungus in the Siberian taiga, smaller indigenous groups in North America such as the Shawnee, Haudenosaunee (Iroquois), or Powhatan, or the various indigenous groups of the rain forest.
Life in temperate forests involves moving between scattered hunting camps in the winter (when hunting deer in the forest is more viable) to summer gatherings. In the tropics, some groups might practice "swidden agriculture" – cutting and burning sections of the jungle in a rotating pattern that, over time, was sustainable for village life. Other groups, such as the Achuar of the Amazon, did not directly cultivate, but seeded particular areas of the forest with crops that would, eventually, become a kind of shadow agriculture. While today many of these groups face increased pressure from logging or mining companies, historically forest peoples traded with urban zones, especially in goods such as furs, medicines, or spices.
