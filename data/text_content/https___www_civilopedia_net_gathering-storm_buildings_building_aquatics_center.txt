Aquatics Center
Description
Bonus
Amenities extend to each city center within 9 tiles. This bonus applies once to a city, and multiple copies of this building within 9 tiles of a city center do not provide additional bonuses. +2
Tourism for each Wonder built in this city on or adjacent to a Coast tile.
Historical Context
There's something to be said about the communal experience of enjoying the pleasure of water activities without the dangers of wild sea and lake creatures interrupting the fun.
Pools and aquatic centers have been a feature of cities for some time; take Pakistan's 'Great Bath,' one of the earliest known pools. Built sometime in 3000 BCE, it was likely a piece of religious construction (as indicated by the lack of slides and diving boards).
Contrast that modest 11.88 x 7.01 meter construction with the massive, 40 meter deep Y-40 pool in Italy (opened in 2014) and you've can see the breadth and depth of the swimming experience.
