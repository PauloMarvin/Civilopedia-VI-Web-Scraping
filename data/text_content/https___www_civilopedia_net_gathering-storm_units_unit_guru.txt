Guru - Units - Civilopedia - Civilization VI
Guru
Description
May use a charge to heal itself and all adjacent friendly religious units. May not initiate theological combat with units of other Religions (but can defend).
Historical Context
The Sanskrit word 'guru' means teacher and yet what is a guru without someone to teach?
Historically, gurus have been both scholars and spiritual guides to their disciples. Which is to say, the guru would not only offer answers, but help their students interpret questions. The guru is thought to be 'heavy' with knowledge, wisdom, and sometimes hidden scripture.
Of course, one would best beware of unofficial gurus out there: these fake gurus have been known to take existing scripture and interject their own thinking.
In the guru-shishya traditions of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism, a potential student would come to the guru's home bearing gifts, showing their willingness to learn. And if the pupil was found acceptable, the guru would then pass along their esoteric or specialized learning.
Similarly, Sikh gurus would retain and reproduce the writing of the gurus who came before. In this way, the guru relationship would ensure that their knowledge would live on across generations.
