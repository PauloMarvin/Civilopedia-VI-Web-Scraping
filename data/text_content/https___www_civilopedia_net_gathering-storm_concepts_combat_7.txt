Combat Bonuses
Warfare is not practiced by just the experienced and well equipped. Military history has shown time and time again that the combatant, using superior tactics, leadership, and the terrain to their advantage can defeat a numerically superior and better equipped force. In Civilization VI, it is no different.
In combining your military might with the right force organization of combined arms, leadership, and intuitive use of terrain you can have the power to destroy your enemies armies, no matter how big or small, advanced or not. Using terrain to your advantage, you can position your forces on Hills, in Rainforests or Woods, and across Rivers from your enemy to ensure a distinct defensive advantage. Looking at the enemies movements across terrain as they approach you can also help you better understand what their battle plan is or where they look to strike.
Terrain can also be detrimental to your fight; be sure to avoid fighting on Flood Plains and Marshes as these have a negative effect on your defensibility. If you find yourself on indefensible terrain, and do not feel you can defeat your enemy on the attack, perhaps building a few Forts will help you push back the enemy. Remember to attack the enemy's flanks, it is their weakest point and will also grant you advantage! Using a well-rounded military force with the proper terrain dispositions while having the use of a Great General will ensure victory!
Flanking and Support bonuses: Outmaneuvering the enemy as well as making sure units in the field are supported by their counterparts is important in order to insure victory in the field. In Civilization VI we simulate this with the Flanking and Support bonuses. Once a player has completed the Military Tradition civic, their military is considered advanced enough in order to benefit from these bonuses.
Flanking: If an enemy melee unit is surrounded by 2 or more adjacent friendly melee units during an attack, it is considered flanked, granting a +2 combat bonus to the melee attacker for each additional flanking melee unit.
Support: When defending against an enemy melee attack, a defending unit can gain a +2 combat bonus for every adjacent friendly unit.
