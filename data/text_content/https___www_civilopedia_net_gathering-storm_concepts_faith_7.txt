Theological Combat
Theological Combat
Theological combat is the best way to defend against other Religions trying to spread across the map. Only Apostles and Inquisitors may initiate theological combat, and then only against other Religious units. You do not need to be at war with another civilization to engage in theological combat. Doing so will not by itself provoke a war, though it could result in negative diplomatic consequences from a Religious pressure drop. Religious units exert a Zone of Control against other religious units, restricting their movement when close.
Theological combat works just like combat with military units, just attack one Religious unit with another. They will deal damage to each other based on their strength. Religious units can get bonuses to their theological combat strength from promotions, policies, flanking and support bonuses from other units, the Theocracy government, if they are in or adjacent to a Holy Site following their Religion, if they are in the territory of a city following their Religion, or a huge bonus if they are in the territory of their Religion's Holy City.
A damaged Religious unit suffers a penalty to the strength of its Spread Religion action, meaning it will convert fewer Followers. If a Religious unit is reduced to 0 Hit Points from theological combat, it will die. When a Religious unit is defeated this way, all cities within 10 tiles have a religious pressure drop of the defeated unit's Religion equal to the strength of an Apostle at full health and then a boost in the victorious unit's Religion of the same amount. If a Religious unit is killed by a hostile military unit, then the Religious pressure will drop in cities within 6 tiles, and the Religious pressure drop is halved.
Religious units can heal any damage they have by staying adjacent to or in a Holy Site in the player's territory, regardless of the Religion of that Holy Site. Religious units heal damage equivalent to 3 times the Faith output of that Holy Site. Some improvements may also act as an alternative source of healing to religious units.
Religious units are also vulnerable to attack from combat units. Condemn Heretic is an action that combat units may take against them when on the same tile, and works similarly to plundering a Trade Route.
