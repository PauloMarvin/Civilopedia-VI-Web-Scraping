Plains Floodplains
Description
This low-lying area adjacent to a River has not yet flooded so it starts the game with the same yields as a flat Plains tile. If the River floods again structures built on this tile may be damaged or destroyed, but the tile is also likely to gain additional yields.
Historical Context
Floodplains are the land surrounding a river which are affected most by flooding, usually seasonal flooding, but this may also apply to wider lowland affected by exceptional flooding events. The inundation of this land deposits sediment from upstream, which refreshes the soil quality and makes the floodplains especially suitable for agriculture.  Many of the first urban civilizations emerged from river valleys with floodplains, such as Mesopotamia, Egypt, and the Indus.
