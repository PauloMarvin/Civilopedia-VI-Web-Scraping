Unit Combat Statistics
Unit Combat Statistics
In Civilization VI, military units have five combat oriented stats: Hit Points,
Combat Strength,
Ranged Strength,
Bombard Strength, and
Range.
All units have 100 Hit Points. As a unit takes damage, it loses Hit Points. A unit is destroyed once it loses all of its Hit Points.
All military units have
Combat Strength. Melee units use their
Combat Strength when attacking or defending. Ranged units use their
Combat Strength when defending.
Any unit that can engage in ranged combat has a
Ranged Strength statistic. This number is compared with the target's
Combat Strength to determine the results of the attack. Land units with a
Ranged Strength can also attack district defenses but at a reduced effectiveness.
Bombard Strength is the anti-district strength of a unit. Units with
Bombard Strength can also attack units, but at a reduced effectiveness. Land units cannot have both a
Bombard and
Ranged Strength, but naval units essentially function as both
Bombard and
Ranged units.
The unit's
Range stat determines the distance at which a unit can launch a ranged attack. A
Range of "2" means that the target can be in an adjacent tile or one tile distant. A
Range of "1" would mean that the target had to be adjacent to the attacker.
Some units have an
anti-air combat value. These units automatically defend against air attacks within their anti-aircraft range. The
anti-air strength is used to evaluate combat with the attacking aircraft.
