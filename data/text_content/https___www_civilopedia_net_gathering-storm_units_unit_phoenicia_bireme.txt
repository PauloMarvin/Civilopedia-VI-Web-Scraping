Bireme
Description
Phoenician unique Ancient Era unit that replaces the Galley. Increased
Combat Strength and
Movement. Trader units are immune to being plundered if they are within 4 tiles of a Bireme and on a water tile.
Historical Context
A bireme is a rowed vessel with two banks of oars for rowers arranged in upper and lower decks and armed with a bow ram. The Phoenicians were the foremost shipbuilders of the ancient world and are generally credited by most archaeologists and historians with creating the bireme design, even though the word “bireme” is Latin. The Phoenicians were also perfectly willing to build warships for anyone with ready cash, whether the Greek city-states, or the Persians, or any other Mediterranean power.
Naval engagements in the ancient world consisted of trying to run down the other side's ships with a bronze-wrapped bow ram while avoiding being rammed in turn, or getting entangled in a sinking ship and being dragged to a watery doom. Ancient sources use adjectives like “chaotic” and “frenzied” and “terrifying” to describe these naval battles, which seems entirely justified. Archaeological evidence attests to a common practice of painting eyes on the bows of many ships to ward off evil.
