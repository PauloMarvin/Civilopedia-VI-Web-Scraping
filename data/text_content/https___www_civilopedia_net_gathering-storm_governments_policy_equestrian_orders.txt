Equestrian Orders
Description
All improved
Horses and
Iron resources yield 1 additional resource per turn.
Historical Context
Because a man on horseback sees himself as physically and morally superior to a man on foot, especially in a military, mounted troops have long enjoyed prestige that extends beyond the military to the society at large. Throughout history, mounted soldiers have been given elevated standing in societies around the world. Certainly the knightly orders and samurai of the middle ages are the best documented examples of this, but the Equites of Rome and the Companions of Alexander, as well as the Keshik of the Mongols count as well (elite even within the cavalry-heavy Mongol army).Sometimes the mounted elite will commandeer state resources towards maintaining their equipment. After all Is not an elite warrior worth a suit of armor, a good sword, and a good horse?
The attitude of the man on foot towards the man on horse has not been documented as well throughout history, but can easily be inferred.
