Saladin (Sultan) - Civilizations/Leaders - Civilopedia - Civilization VI
Saladin (Sultan)
Unique Ability
The Victorious
+100% Flanking and Support Bonus to all Combat and Religious units.
Summary
Defeating opponents with either military or Religion is at the heart of playing with Sultan Saladin.
Detailed Approach
Being guaranteed a Great Prophet allows Sultan Saladin a chance to build up his military until his free Great Prophet arrives. After the Great Prophet is received, go forth spreading Arabia’s Religion and military across the map. The Mamluk will be an asset in conquering faraway civilizations with its ability to heal every turn. The Madrasa will help you unlock stronger military units while also allowing the purchase of more Apostles. Arabia under the Sultan Saladin’s leadership is great for either Domination or Religious Victories.
When Allah decides a matter, it is done.
