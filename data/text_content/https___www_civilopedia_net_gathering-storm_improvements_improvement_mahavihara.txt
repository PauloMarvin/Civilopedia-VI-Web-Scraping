Historical Context
A vihara is the Sanskrit and Pali term for a Buddhist monastery; “Maha” simply means “great,” so the “mahavihara” just means a large center for monastic life. Buddhist monks in a vihara are not the stereotype of silent worshippers simply seeking enlightenment via meditation. Rather, many monasteries are places of active learning – devotees are exposed to a wide variety of knowledge and encouraged to debate religious and scientific truths. The mahavihara of Nalanda was a massive complex that brought visitors from all across Asia precisely for this discussion and exchange. It contained within it a library that contained knowledge both of Buddhism as well as  literature and science, including several famous texts: Nagarjuna’s Madhyamaka, or the doctrine of emptiness; as well as the Four Vedas – Sanskrit texts that are vital to both Buddhism and Hinduism. Vihara are still present today – the terms “wihan” and “vihear” in Thai and Cambodian, respectively, refer to the main functional structure in a Buddhist temple.
