Commercial Hub
Description
A district in your city specializing in finance and trade.
Historical Context
The “commercial hub” of a city usually refers to the downtown business district, where capitalism and greed enliven the city’s finances. Here are the markets, banks and exchanges that make a few folks rich and fuel city growth. In time, evolving from a simple collection of local financiers and corporate offices, a commercial hub might even grow into a “global financial center.” There is even a system for ranking such global centers; until 2013 London held the top spot on the Global Financial Centers Index, when it was supplanted by New York City, both closely followed by Hong Kong, Singapore, and Tokyo. The quest for profit is obviously a universal trait of civilization.
