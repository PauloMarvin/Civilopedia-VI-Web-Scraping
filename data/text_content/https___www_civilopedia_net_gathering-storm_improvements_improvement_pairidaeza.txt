Historical Context
A pairidaeza is a specific style of garden consisting of cultivated land within an enclosure. Also known as a “paradise garden,” the pairidaeza is thought to originate in the time of the Assyrian Empire. Its rectangular construction serves to contrast the external wildness of nature with an ordered and beautiful garden. Water was often an important element of their construction—ponds, canals, or even fountains flowed freely within the walls.
As a tool of state, they were invaluable in flaunting a kingdom’s ability to bring life to an area that would otherwise have none. The Achaemenid dynasty melded the pairidaeza with their royal hunting parks, a not so subtle way to show their command over both their empire and the natural world within it.
