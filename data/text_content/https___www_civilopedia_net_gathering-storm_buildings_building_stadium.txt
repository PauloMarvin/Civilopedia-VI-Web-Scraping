Historical Context
A stadium is a better version of the colosseum, with a wider selection of snacks and more restrooms. The oldest known stadium, an open-air venue dedicated to worshipping sporting competitions, was in the western Peloponnese and served as the site of the ancient Olympic Games, first held c. 776 BC. Greek and Roman stadiums have been found in the ruins of many cities, a testament to their culture of competition. With the growth of leisure and the popularity of organized sports in the Victorian Age – notably football (soccer for the uncivilized) in Europe and baseball in America – stadiums were being built at a furious pace across the globe. Most of those industrial-age stadiums were built of wood, such as that at Lansdowne Road in Dublin (1872-2006) or the South End Grounds in Boston (1871-1914). These days, modern concrete-and-steel stadiums can hold upwards of 100 thousand screaming, obnoxious fans for a sporting match, rock concert, or political rally.
