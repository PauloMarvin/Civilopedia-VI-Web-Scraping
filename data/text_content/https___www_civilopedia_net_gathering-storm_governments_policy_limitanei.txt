Limitanei
Description
+2 Loyalty per turn for cities with a garrisoned unit.
Historical Context
Limitanei were the frontier garrison troops of the late Western Roman Empire and early Byzantine Empire, their name deriving from the same root as the word for “military border district”—limes. Over time these troops devolved into a locally-recruited militia under arms for the Romans, and lost some of the prestige and professionalism of the other forces of the empire.
