Movement Points
Movement Points
All mobile units have a certain number of
Movement points that they can expend on
Movement every turn. Once they've expended those
Movement points, they can't move any more until the next turn. Units expend
Movement points to enter tiles, to attack other units, or to pillage improvements or districts. The terrain of the tile a unit is entering determines the
Movement point cost of the move.
