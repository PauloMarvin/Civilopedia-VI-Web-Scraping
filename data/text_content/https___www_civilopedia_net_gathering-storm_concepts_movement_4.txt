Naval Movement
Generally, naval units follow the same rules as land units, except that they move in the water rather than on land. Early naval units are often limited to coastal waters (those adjacent to land tiles) and coastal cities. Eventually, you'll produce naval units that can enter deep ocean tiles, and thus explore the world.
