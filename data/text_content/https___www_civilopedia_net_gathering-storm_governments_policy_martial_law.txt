Martial Law
Description
Accumulate 25% less war weariness than usual. Cities with a garrisoned unit get +4 Loyalty per turn.
Historical Context
Martial law is that legalism by which military law “temporarily” supersedes civil law, declared by a government whereby it doesn’t have to worry about such niceties as civil rights, habeas corpus, civil courts (civilians defying martial law can be tried by military tribunals), and can impose curfews, travel bans, rationing, and such at will. In effect, all power is transferred to the military, and is removed from the previous executive, legislative, and judicial authorities (some of whom may well be imprisoned themselves). There are many potential reasons for imposition of martial law “to restore order”: following a coup (as in Thailand in 2006) or a natural disaster (the San Francisco earthquake), perhaps during labor unrest (the Colorado Coalfields War) or war (as in Hawaii from 1941 to 1944).
