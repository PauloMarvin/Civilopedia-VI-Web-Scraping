Dar-e Mehr
Description
+1 additional
Faith for each era since constructed or last repaired. Cannot be pillaged by natural disasters.
Historical Context
First seen around the Ninth Century BCE, the first Zoroastrian structures called 'Dar-e Mehr' are linked to the concept of 'Atar' ("holy fire"). The fire and clean water at the center of the Dar-e Mehr aren't worshipped, but instead a means to gain ritual purity.
A temple would be named depending on the type of fire housed within, with the holiest being the "Fire of Victory," or 'Atash Behram,' requiring 32 priests and a year of burning fires from 16 sanctified sources to be considered consecrated.
These temples, usually constructed on a hill or higher location, contain ritualized flames housed in a chamber called the atashgah. However, if you're a non-believer, don't expect to see the atashgah or the flame inside: tradition dictates that only the faithful be allowed to view the holy fire.
