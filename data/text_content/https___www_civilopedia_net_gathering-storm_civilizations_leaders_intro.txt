Introduction
Every civilization has a leader. Some civilizations only have one choice for a leader, while others have multiple leaders from which to choose. Like civilizations, each leader has a unique trait. These traits are different from civilization traits and are specific to each leader, even leaders from within the same civilization. Every leader also has an agenda based on their historical persona, as well as a hidden, random agenda.
