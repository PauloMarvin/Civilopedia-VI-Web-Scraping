Seasteads
Description
Awards 1 Diplomatic Victory point.
Historical Context
By custom, the sea is a place of its own laws, under the control of no nation. This makes it attractive for people who wish to experiment with new models of government, and so the idea of “seasteading” is the creation of new micro-nations at sea. As of the publication of this game, no permanent, sustainable Seasteads have been created, but many organizations around the world continue to explore the practical implementation of seasteading, whether by creating artificial islands or converting large sea-going vessels (like retired cruise ships) into permanent Seasteads.
“I must go down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life, To the gull’s way and the whale’s way where the wind’s like a whetted knife;”
– John Masefield
“Then you drive out where the storm-clouds swallow, And the sound of your oar-blades, falling hollow, As all we have left through the months to follow.”
– Rudyard Kipling
