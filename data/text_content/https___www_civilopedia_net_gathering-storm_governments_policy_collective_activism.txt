Collective Activism

Culture per city-state you are the Suzerain of.
Historical Context
While liberal (in the economic sense) economists proposed the idea that people were strongest when working in their individual interest, sociologists pointed to the power of rallying around a common idea, a common good. In the latter half of the 20th Century, a number of activist leaders (Gandhi, King, Mandela, etc.) called for non-violent collective actions – boycotts, rallies, strikes, sit-ins, marches, petitions, educational programs, and such – to effect social, economic, political, and environmental changes. In industrial nations with semi-democratic governments, these have proven effective (sometimes). Collective activism has now gone viral, with social media and the internet now encouraging public support (financial, if nothing else) for these movements.
