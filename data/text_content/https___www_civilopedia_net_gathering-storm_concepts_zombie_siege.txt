Zombie Defense
Welcome
The Zombie Defense game mode introduces a dangerous threat to your Civilization: the dead that don’t stay dead. Zombies can rise from the ashes of war, and as they prey upon your and other’s lands, they spread their deadly curse onwards. Try to keep them from overwhelming your cities, at least for one more turn!
Zombies
Zombies are melee units that wander the wastes. They cannot pillage your Improvements; they’re just not interested in that. But they will go immediately for any unit wandering about outside, so make sure that you keep an eye open when leaving your cities. They can also attack your cities, turning any destroyed Population into more zombies...
When a unit dies on the map, it carries a slight chance of returning as a Zombie unit some turns later. However, if a unit is destroyed by a Zombie, it will certainly rise again on the following turn. The undead menace steadily grows, though – for each Zombie killed anywhere in the world, remaining and new Zombies get stronger and stronger. Make sure you know what you’re getting into when you go to war with the dead!
Holy Sites and Campuses hold a temporary solution to the zombie horde. Using the Turn Undead project at a Holy Site, or the Dark Signal project at a Campus will allow you to briefly take control of Zombies within your city limits, meaning that you can turn the horde against your enemies. Just be sure to be safely out of reach when your control expires… or when you strategically end it. In addition, your Spies can spread the deadly curse to your enemies with the Zombie Outbreak action.
Defense
Your lands are not without defenses against the horde. In addition to the Projects at Holy Sites or Campuses, your builders can create Barricades or Traps to help to fend off your enemies (living or dead). A Barricade deals a minor amount of damage to any hostile unit who passes through it or adjacent tiles, and a Trap deals a significant amount of damage to any hostile unit that passes directly through it. Later eras can grant the ability to create more powerful Barricades or Traps.
While these can be powerful defenses against the living dead, they can also be useful against your more – vivacious – enemies, as they deal damage to any sort of enemy. Plan these strategically, and you might just last the night.
