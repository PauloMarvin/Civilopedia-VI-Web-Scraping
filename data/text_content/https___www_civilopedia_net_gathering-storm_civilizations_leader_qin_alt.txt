Qin (Unifier)
Unique Ability
Thirty-Six Stratagems
Melee units receive the Convert Barbarians action. This action converts Barbarian units into your units, but it removes the melee unit.
Summary
Barbarians are your allies to recruit with your Melee units to unify the world under Qin’s banner.
Detailed Approach
Qin is best when he lets Barbarians begin their invasion, and then turns them over to his side, a strategy that may involve sacrificing a Melee unit to get an army of Barbarians. He can further protect his empire with the Great Wall’s added defense and the Crouching Tiger. Use his extra Eurekas and Inspirations to unlock more powerful units, and move forward to a Domination victory with your Barbarian converts.
I have collected all the writings of the Empire and burnt those which were of no use.
