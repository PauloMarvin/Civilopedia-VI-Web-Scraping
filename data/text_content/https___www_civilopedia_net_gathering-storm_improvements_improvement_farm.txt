Farm - Improvements and Routes - Civilopedia - Civilization VI
Farm
Description
Unlocks the Builder ability to construct Farms.
+1
Food. Can only be built on Grassland or Plains.
Constructing farms adjacent to other Farms provides bonuses to Housing.
Historical Context
Once people figured out that it was a lot easier to stay in one place and grow crops, rather than wander about gathering whatever happened to be growing, “civilization” broke out. Around 12,000 years ago, this was the “Neolithic Revolution.” Farming meant that permanent settlements could be self-sustaining, and that the more food that could be harvested, the bigger settlements could grow. Ever since, advances in technology have been making agriculture more efficient: irrigation, machinery, fertilizers, pesticides, GMOs and so forth. Yields skyrocketed.
