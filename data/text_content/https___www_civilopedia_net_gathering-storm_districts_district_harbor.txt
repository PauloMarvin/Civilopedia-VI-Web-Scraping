Harbor - Districts - Civilopedia - Civilization VI
Harbor
Description
A district for naval activity in your city. Also removes the
Movement penalty for embarking and disembarking to and from this tile. Must be built on Coast or Lake Terrain adjacent to land. Cannot be built on Reef.
Historical Context
Safe haven, shelter from storms, place to rest and refit, harbor. As soon as men went sailing, the need for harbors became evident. Early civilizations sought out natural harbors, and history has been often defined by where these maritime settlements sat. In time, breakwaters, jetties, seawalls, lighthouses, and drydocks were added, and the seabed was dredged if necessary to keep the harbor open. The harbors were the centers of trade and naval war, the launch point for exploration and end point for immigration. As technology developed, “artificial” harbors could now be built to handle modern merchant ships – such as Long Beach Harbor, created from salt marshes and tidal flats – using concrete, steel, dredge barges, and pumping stations.
