Airstrip
Description
Unlocks the Military Engineer ability to construct an Airstrip.
Can support 3 air units. Can only be built on flat terrain. -1 Appeal.
Historical Context
When early aeronauts needed a place to land in a hurry, any field that was fairly level and without things sticking up would serve … much to the surprise of many a farmer. In time, some of these became well-known and often used, thus an “airstrip.” In remote locations around the world, these extended air travel to everywhere. Most consisted of a grassy runway and perhaps some fueling storage tanks and pumps. Not many amenities, but these weren’t intended for tourists and the casual traveler. Unlike aerodromes and airports – although some airstrips did mature into these – airstrips were more for unplanned stops than not, or as a means to land near some backwater settlement. Oil fields, lumber camps, sheep stations, cattle ranches and the like often boosted an airstrip. Some still do.
