Great Engineer
Description
Each
Great Engineer has unique abilities when activated. Visit the Great People panel to learn more, and track your progress.
Historical Context
Engineers design and build workshops, schools, and homes; “great” engineers design and build wonders. Before the day of pre-fab buildings, uniform ticky-tack housing “estates,” stressed concrete and I-beam girders, these were the men (and women) who celebrated civilization in towering monuments, grand palaces, massive temples, vital dams and bridges, and structures of every kind. It’s their work that archaeologists dig up, tourists gawk at, and children learn about in school. Give thanks too for the indoor plumbing, electrical lights, and autobahns (along with everything else that makes life comfortable) that they designed and built. Without the great engineers dreaming in stone and steel, constructing skyscrapers, giving the world sports stadiums and shopping malls, how else would anyone even know civilization when they stumbled out of the wilderness?
