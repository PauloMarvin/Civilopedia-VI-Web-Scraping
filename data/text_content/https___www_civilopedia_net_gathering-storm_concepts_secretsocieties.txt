Secret Societies
Welcome
In game setup, players can turn on the Secret Societies game mode, introducing powerful and mysterious new forces to the world.
Make Contact
There are four Secret Societies operating in the shadows around the world. To make contact, seek out a Society where its influence might hide: Barbarian Outposts, Tribal Villages, Natural Wonders, or City-States. Discovery is not guaranteed, but you are more likely to find a Society that other players have not discovered, or on continents where no Society has yet been discovered.
The Owls of Minerva are a secret group of high-placed and wealthy individuals. They focus on government, trade, and espionage. Attempt contact by sending
Envoys to City-States where you currently have no
Envoys.
The Hermetic Order is a society of unorthodox scientists and alchemists. Their work focuses on science, great people, and resources. Attempt contact by discovering Natural Wonders.
The Voidsingers are a nihilistic cult of dark elder gods. They focus on religion, relics, and (dis)loyalty. Attempt contact by investigating Tribal Villages.
The Sanguine Pact share an unhealthy appetite for blood. They focus on building a strong military. Attempt contact by capturing Barbarian Camps.
Alternatively, reaching the
Secret level of diplomatic visibility on another player will automatically make contact with that player's Society. Once you do make contact with a Society, you will be able to see which other leaders are members by visiting the Diplomacy screen, even if you do not join it.
Initiation
Making contact with a Secret Society is only the first step. It unlocks a unique
Governor with powerful bonuses, which you do not need to assign to a city. To become a full-fledged member of the Society, appoint the corresponding Governor. Once you become a member of a Society, you are locked into that Society for the rest of the game.
Alliances with players who are members of the same Society generate Alliance Points more quickly, and those players will have an improved opinion of you in diplomacy. Players who are members of a different Society, however, will dislike you once they are aware of your affiliation.
Deeper Mysteries
Each
Governor has four promotions, unlocked sequentially. Unlike normal Governor promotions, a promotion's effect is not revealed until the previous promotion is earned. (If you prefer not to be surprised, keep reading the Civilopedia.)
Secret Societies need generations of time to lay their plans, so not all promotions are available right away. The second promotion is available when the game enters the Medieval Era. The third is available in the Industrial Era. The final one is available in the Atomic Era.
