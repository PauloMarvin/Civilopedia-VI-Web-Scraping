Land Surveyors
Description
Reduces the cost of purchasing a tile by 20%.
Historical Context
Once the idea of ownership of the land was ingrained in humanity, methods for determining boundaries were necessary. In ancient Egypt, a rope with knots could be used with simple geometry to re-establish boundaries after the annual floods along the Nile. Land surveyors were also at work around those old monuments tourists are now enamored of; Stonehenge was laid out by surveyors using pegs and ropes, as was the Great Pyramid of Giza. The Chinese Liu Hui described methods of surveying in works published c. 263 AD. But it was the Romans who first acknowledged land surveying as a profession; there, surveyors were known as Gromatici, so named after the Groma instrument dating back to ancient Mesopotamia.
