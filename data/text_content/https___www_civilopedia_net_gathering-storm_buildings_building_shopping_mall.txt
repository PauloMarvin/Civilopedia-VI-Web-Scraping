Shopping Mall
Description
+4
Tourism. Can only be built once in a city, even if the city has multiple Neighborhoods.
Historical Context
The modern shopping mall is an extension of Ancient Rome's public markets—albeit with better access to fresh baked pretzel dogs.
Malls, or shopping arcades, centralized collections of shops in one location. Some, like Damascus' Al-Hamidiyah Souq in the 19th Century, were essentially covered markets, while St. Petersburg's Great Gostiny Dvor would offer an earlier 'traditional' mall experience in 1785.
By the mid-Twentieth Century, the enclosed shopping complex as we know it would arrive in 1955 with Appleton, Wisconsin's Valley Fair Shopping Center and the Ralph Erskine-designed mall in Lulea, Sweden. Frozen yogurt stands would follow not too long after.
