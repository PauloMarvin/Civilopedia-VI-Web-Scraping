Introduction
Every civilization is unique, each having their own "trait," fighting units, and infrastructure. A civilization’s leader also has their own special trait - some traits appear early-on in a match, while others might only show up later. All of a civilization's and leader's traits, unique units, and infrastructure are displayed during game setup when choosing a civilization.
