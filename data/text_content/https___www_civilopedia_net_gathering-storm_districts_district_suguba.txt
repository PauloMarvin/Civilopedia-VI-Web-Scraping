Faith in this City.
+2
Gold bonus for each adjacent Holy Site. +2
Gold bonus from a tile containing a River edge. +1
Gold bonus for every two adjacent district tiles.
Historical Context
In the Mande language, Suguba means “big market,” and as the Malian empire was built on trade, one would naturally expect a bustling and vibrant market. Most of the cities of Mali have large market districts, crowded with vendors and customers. In the past, Malian gold and salt would have purchased a variety of goods from across Africa and Europe, which would have found their way into Malian markets.
Should you visit a Malian Suguba, bring a shopping list and be prepared to negotiate your prices (bargaining is expected, and to fail to do so would be to commit a serious faux pas.) In addition to more mundane goods like food and electronics, you should keep an eye out for Mali's famous fabrics: Bazin and bogolanfini. Bazin is a lustrous, colorful fabric made by the methodical hammering of cotton cloth, much prized by fashion designers around the world. Malians are said to be discriminating connoisseurs of bazin. Bogolanfini is a mud-dyed fabric of warm browns, deep blacks, and sharp whites, first worn by hunters, but now an important cultural symbol for Mali.
