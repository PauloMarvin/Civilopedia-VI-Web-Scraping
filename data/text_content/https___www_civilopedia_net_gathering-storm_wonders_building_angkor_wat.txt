Angkor Wat
Description
+1
Population  in all Current Cities when built. +1
Housing in all cities.
Must be built adjacent to an Aqueduct district.
Historical Context
It has stood for nearly 1,000 years, a monument to a god and possibly the final resting place of the conqueror king who built it.
And still, the temple at Angkor Wat endures, its central tower rising 213 feet above the surrounding jungle. Constructed by the Khmer King Suryavarman II in the Twelfth century in what is now northern Cambodia, it is one of the world's tallest religious monuments.
A pilgrim to the city-temple of the Hindu God Vishnu would first cross a 650-foot wide and 14-feet deep moat surrounding the structure before entering a 'gopura,' a three-towered entrance leading to a raised walkway. Inside the temple complex proper, they would find four smaller towers surrounding one central 213-foot tower, evoking the sacred Mount Meru.
Khmer Shaivist temples typically face east, but because Angkor Wat faces west, the final resting place for Suryavarman's remains would be a temple honoring Vishnu.
“The temple is surrounded by a moat, and access is by a single bridge, protected by two stone tigers so grand and fearsome as to strike terror into the visitor.”
– Diogo do Couto
