Experience and Promotions
A unit that survives combat or discovers a Tribal Village will gain "Experience Points" (XP). Once a unit reaches a certain amount of XP it will 'level up', at which point it can receive a promotion. Promotions enhance the unit in some way. When selecting a promotion, the unit is healed an amount of Hit Points. The unit will not continue to gain any further XP until the promotion is selected.
