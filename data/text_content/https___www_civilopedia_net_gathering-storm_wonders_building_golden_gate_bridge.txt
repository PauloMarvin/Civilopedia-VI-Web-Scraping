Historical Context
Nestled in the San Francisco fog is the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, a 1.7 mile long suspension bridge that defied everything believed to be true about engineering when it was completed in 1937. Spanning across the Golden Gate Strait, this wonder of the modern world connects San Francisco to northern California counties, providing a necessary commuter route and unnecessary traffic for residents and visitors alike.
Though its name suggests the color of its beams, the bridge is actually painted International Orange. Although this wasn't the original intended color for the project – black and yellow stripes were the leading choice – it complemented the landscape and gave the bridge some much needed visibility in the fog. So much visibility that it is believed to be the most photographed bridge in the world, and has made its mark on pop culture in movies, television, and video games.
“The golden gates of Sleep unbar
Where Strength and Beauty, met together,
Kindle their image like a star
In a sea of glassy weather!”
